## Overview
- Resolves domains to IP addresses
- How it works:
	1) Computer asks for DNS query
	2) DNS resolver checks its map recursively
	3) Root Name server points the way
	4) TLD Name server points it down
	5) Authoritative Name server delivers the address
	6) DNS resolver returns the Information 
	7) Computer connects

## Host files
- File that maps hostnames to IP addresses 
- On *Windows* it is in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
- On *Linux* it is in `/etc/hosts`

#### Example host file
```txt
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.10    devserver.local
```

## Key DNS Concepts
- In DNS a *zone* is part of the domain namespace that specifies a container for a set of domain names
	- `example.com` could have `mail.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, etc

#### Example zone file
```txt
$TTL 3600 ; Default Time-To-Live (1 hour)
@       IN SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                2024060401 ; Serial number (YYYYMMDDNN)
                3600       ; Refresh interval
                900        ; Retry interval
                604800     ; Expire time
                86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@       IN NS    ns1.example.com.
@       IN NS    ns2.example.com.
@       IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
www     IN A     192.0.2.1
mail    IN A     198.51.100.1
ftp     IN CNAME www.example.com.
```
- Defines authoritative name servers, *NS records*, *MX records*, and *A records* (ip address)

### Other DNS concepts
|DNS Concept|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`Domain Name`|A human-readable label for a website or other internet resource.|`www.example.com`|
|`IP Address`|A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to the internet.|`192.0.2.1`|
|`DNS Resolver`|A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.|Your ISP's DNS server or public resolvers like Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`)|
|`Root Name Server`|The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.|There are 13 root servers worldwide, named A-M: `a.root-servers.net`|
|`TLD Name Server`|Servers responsible for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org).|[Verisign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign) for `.com`, [PIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Registry) for `.org`|
|`Authoritative Name Server`|The server that holds the actual IP address for a domain.|Often managed by hosting providers or domain registrars.|
|`DNS Record Types`|Different types of information stored in DNS.|A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.|
### Types of Records
|Record Type|Full Name|Description|Zone File Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|`A`|Address Record|Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address.|`www.example.com.` IN A `192.0.2.1`|
|`AAAA`|IPv6 Address Record|Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address.|`www.example.com.` IN AAAA `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334`|
|`CNAME`|Canonical Name Record|Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.|`blog.example.com.` IN CNAME `webserver.example.net.`|
|`MX`|Mail Exchange Record|Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain.|`example.com.` IN MX 10 `mail.example.com.`|
|`NS`|Name Server Record|Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.|`example.com.` IN NS `ns1.example.com.`|
|`TXT`|Text Record|Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.|`example.com.` IN TXT `"v=spf1 mx -all"` (SPF record)|
|`SOA`|Start of Authority Record|Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters.|`example.com.` IN SOA `ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400`|
|`SRV`|Service Record|Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.|`_sip._udp.example.com.` IN SRV 10 5 5060 `sipserver.example.com.`|
|`PTR`|Pointer Record|Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.|`1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.` IN PTR `www.example.com.`|

## DNS Tools

|Tool|Key Features|Use Cases|
|---|---|---|
|`dig`|Versatile DNS lookup tool that supports various query types (A, MX, NS, TXT, etc.) and detailed output.|Manual DNS queries, zone transfers (if allowed), troubleshooting DNS issues, and in-depth analysis of DNS records.|
|`nslookup`|Simpler DNS lookup tool, primarily for A, AAAA, and MX records.|Basic DNS queries, quick checks of domain resolution and mail server records.|
|`host`|Streamlined DNS lookup tool with concise output.|Quick checks of A, AAAA, and MX records.|
|`dnsenum`|Automated DNS enumeration tool, dictionary attacks, brute-forcing, zone transfers (if allowed).|Discovering subdomains and gathering DNS information efficiently.|
|`fierce`|DNS reconnaissance and subdomain enumeration tool with recursive search and wildcard detection.|User-friendly interface for DNS reconnaissance, identifying subdomains and potential targets.|
|`dnsrecon`|Combines multiple DNS reconnaissance techniques and supports various output formats.|Comprehensive DNS enumeration, identifying subdomains, and gathering DNS records for further analysis.|
|`theHarvester`|OSINT tool that gathers information from various sources, including DNS records (email addresses).|Collecting email addresses, employee information, and other data associated with a domain from multiple sources.|
|`Online DNS Lookup Services`|User-friendly interfaces for performing DNS lookups.|Quick and easy DNS lookups, convenient when command-line tools are not available, checking for domain availability or basic information|

## Domain Information Groper
- Also known as the `dig` command
- Good for query DNS servers for DNS records

### Dig Commands
|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`dig domain.com`|Performs a default A record lookup for the domain.|
|`dig domain.com A`|Retrieves the IPv4 address (A record) associated with the domain.|
|`dig domain.com AAAA`|Retrieves the IPv6 address (AAAA record) associated with the domain.|
|`dig domain.com MX`|Finds the mail servers (MX records) responsible for the domain.|
|`dig domain.com NS`|Identifies the authoritative name servers for the domain.|
|`dig domain.com TXT`|Retrieves any TXT records associated with the domain.|
|`dig domain.com CNAME`|Retrieves the canonical name (CNAME) record for the domain.|
|`dig domain.com SOA`|Retrieves the start of authority (SOA) record for the domain.|
|`dig @1.1.1.1 domain.com`|Specifies a specific name server to query; in this case 1.1.1.1|
|`dig +trace domain.com`|Shows the full path of DNS resolution.|
|`dig -x 192.168.1.1`|Performs a reverse lookup on the IP address 192.168.1.1 to find the associated host name. You may need to specify a name server.|
|`dig +short domain.com`|Provides a short, concise answer to the query.|
|`dig +noall +answer domain.com`|Displays only the answer section of the query output.|
|`dig domain.com ANY`|Retrieves all available DNS records for the domain (Note: Many DNS servers ignore `ANY` queries to reduce load and prevent abuse, as per [RFC 8482](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8482)).|
#### Groping DNS
```bash
SonithGT@htb[/htb]$ dig google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.18.24-0ubuntu0.22.04.1-Ubuntu <<>> google.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

- Output can be broken down into four parts:
	1) *Header:* `;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 16449`. 
		- This query shows it suceeded because of `NOERROR` which a id of `16449`
		- `;; flags: qr rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0` Shows `qr` the query response flag, `rd` to show recursion was requested, and `ad` to show data was authentic
	2) *Question Section:* `;google.com. IN A` means what is the ip address of `google.com`
	3) *Answer Section:* `google.com. 0 IN A 142.251.47.142` is the answer to previous question about the IP 
	4) *Footer:* 
		- `;; Query time: 0 msec` means how long it took the query to process
		- `;; SERVER: 172.23.176.1#53(172.23.176.1) (UDP)` is the dns server that gave the answer
		- `;; WHEN: Thu Jun 13 10:45:58 SAST 2024` Timestamp when the query was made
		- `;; MSG SIZE rcvd: 54` Indicates size of the DNS message received
